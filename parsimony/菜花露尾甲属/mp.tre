>Heuristic search settings:
>   Optimality criterion = maximum parsimony
>      Character-status summary:
>        Of 60 total characters:
>          All characters are of type 'unord'
>          All characters have equal weight
>          1 character is constant
>          11 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>          Number of parsimony-informative characters = 48
>      Gaps are treated as "missing"
>   Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>   Addition sequence: random
>      Number of replicates = 10
>      Starting seed = 569331348
>   Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
>   Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
>   Steepest descent option not in effect
>   Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
>   Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>   'MulTrees' option in effect
>   Topological constraints not enforced
>   Trees are unrooted
>
>Heuristic search completed
>   Total number of rearrangements tried = 27757
>   Score of best tree(s) found = 174
>   Number of trees retained = 11
